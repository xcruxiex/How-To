## **__How to change your background__**
*(example used is https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v6)*

> Once you have read https://github.com/xcruxiex/How-To/blob/master/Default-Text-Editor.md, proceed through this guide.

Once you have your theme file open, make sure you can see the variable `--background-image`.

Now find an image (the same resolution as your monitor is advised e.g. 1920x1080) and upload it to http://imgur.com. 
This site has a 99% uptime and is perfect for background image hosting.

Now you must get the link from the imgur image, to do this right click the image and view it. 

This should show a link like `https://i.imgur.com/randomnumbersandletters.png`

After this, you need to edit the file like so ![https://i.imgur.com/6lEvCK5.png](https://i.imgur.com/6lEvCK5.png)

The file type does not matter, just needs to appear in the link (can be .png or .jpg etc).

> Once you have changed the link properly, save the file and refresh discord, the image should now appear as your background. Enjoy!
